# Pomodoro Seal Timer
### Created by Maulahna Robinson

As a fun summer project, I have decided to create a seal-themed Pomodoro timer. The Pomodoro study technique is a method that utilizes a timer to break down work periods into timed intervals, separated by short breaks. I frequently utilize this technique during the school year, and I decided to create a timer based around my favorite animal!
